## "identity is a paradox" - air_eat

read my [previous post](/blog/self) for context.

it's finally a new year, and the past few months have felt like a complete bomb in some aspects.
several things have happened since the previous post, and i feel like the old post has become too superficial
and can therefore be considered a bit outdated.

a week after writing the post i finally bought a tail and that
combined with me living alone (don't have to constantly mask in general for likely the first time in my life)
completely fueled my sensory stuff for about a month. there were times were i could barely do anything
because i was stuck lying in bed meowing and feeling like my body was changing (even though i was aware that
it wasn't going to actually change), sometimes unable to do or feel anything else even if i wanted to.

buying a tail helped my feelings of phantom limb syndrome but now every time i don't wear it i feel like
people can see it anyways because i feel like it's there. this has made me now have to check every time i go outside if
it's actually there in case i didn't take it off. i get racing thoughts of needing to have fur and needing my fur to be pet.
i feel like the human body fundamentally limits my ways of self expression, which likely ties into my autism.
i need to purr when i feel comfortable. i need to be able to move my ears depending on my mood. i need a tail to wag.
i need to meow at people until they figure out what i need.

despite everything, i feel like all this therian shit goes even deeper, like there's still more to it,
guess i'll see how it develops.
i feel like i need my identity to further evolve. i'm gonna try to see a therapist soon to get help with this.
during the weeks of the most intense periods i was genuinely scared i'm gonna develop schizophrenia or something.
like how i felt sometimes was definitely way too much for me to consider it normal.
i started somewhat venting in my bluesky (and then bsky became popular again and many javascript developers
started following a confused cat who just happened to code in the same language as them).

i don't feel comfortable calling myself human and i feel fundamentally uncomfortable in people recognizing me
as the same species as them. i sometimes refer to my hands as paws, my skin as fur, etc because it's sometimes
the only way i can refer to myself without feeling uncomfortable. i feel like all of this is not unlike having preferred pronouns.

speaking of pronouns, some months ago i tried out she/it. i didn't fully get it/its pronouns and i wanted to see how it felt.
safe to say those are my pronouns now. it/its feels just like a creature, not human but a secret other thing. it just feels right.
i still like she/her, so she/it it is.

in short, i feel overwhelmed by what i am, but in limbo regardless.
having to mask this on and off is exhausting, and just leaves me even more clueless.
i can't mask this off forever and i'm already clearly failing at doing so. i just need headpats. thanks for reading
