i want to use this blog more often, so i'm announcing here that tinyglobby now has a proper documentation page!!

it took a while to set up but it should be much better than a tiny `README.md` file
that loosely explained what the options do. i wrote it from scratch using [shiki](https://shiki.style)
for twoslash + syntax highlighting. i really like how it looks!! ive never seen anyone use twoslash this way
to provide type documentation

this should be great for users as there have been many questions asking for clarification or
how the library works and how to use it. also many users using the wrong options qwq

you can check it out [here](/tinyglobby) :3
