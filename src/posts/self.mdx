over the last few months you might have seen me tweeting\* things like this:

![tweet\* of me saying meowp](/images/meowp.png#330)

and, right now it's a bit of an open secret the fact that i just like to act like a cat sometimes

funny enough, it's in my personality too. many people have told me over the years that i am "cat-coded" without me even trying.
actually that's been happening for as long as i can remember.

you might think that i'm just being quirky and funny, but it just kinda feels good acting like
that to some point, i mean, in a way. but the more i thought about it, the more i thought to myself "god i wish i was a cat".
at first it was just like as a joke, but i just kinda started to develop feelings around it over time.

if you know what the symbols at the top of this article mean, you probably know where i'm going with this, but like,
calling myself a cat just started feeling more comfortable and right at some point.

it felt good but it also made me realize how disconnected i am from society and humanity in general,
which kinda freaked me out. and, uh.

i'm not gonna vaguely hint at it anymore.

where do i even begin.

\*i'm never calling them posts

## therianthropy

questioning how i feel about my humanity for that long lead me to eventually find out about the concept of
a therian and its community surrounding it. (actually i somewhat knew about the topic before but i didn't go
deep into that at the time). to put it short, at its core a therian is basically someone who identifies as
a non-human animal in some way to some extent.

there is a small catch though, and it's that what you might see online about therians is generally, not correct information.

the (public-facing) therian community seems to be just full of children, probably because the older part of the community
isn't that open about it. and the ones who are open about it only talk about it in like,
their blog or something, or in more obscure parts of the internet. popular trans figures online who just happen to
also be therian include maia arson crimew (the one behind the nofly list leak) and patricia taxxon.

in a way what has become mainstream about therians online is just a meaningless blob of misconceptions.

also if you're wondering, yes, ΘΔ is the unicode representation of the therian symbol. at least it looks badass.

how it's caused isn't clear, but neurodivergency seems to be correlated with it. some believe that it's an
spiritual thing but i think its just psychological.

now, how does that relate to me? haha, well. let's just say.

other than me by definition being one i have some sort of, sensory related stuff that comes into play.
i mean to be fair my neurodivergency plays a role in me being so disconnected from society, but hear me out:

i feel really incomplete with my physical body. humans are different from cats,<sup>[citation needed]</sup> sadly.
there are so many aspects of myself that would just feel much better and right if only i had less human more cat
features.\*\*

i kinda relate it to gender dysphoria as the feelings are really similar. you know something is missing in many ways.
but unlike gender dysphoria there's not really any kind of hormones that can help in this situation.

i wish people just saw me more as "oh look that's a creature, i wonder if itd let me pet it" rather than "hi girl what's
your favorite economic structure of society".

but other than that, and i know it sounds weird: i literally feel phantom limbs from my missing body parts, especially my tail.
apparently if your brain really feels like something should be part of your body it just kinda pretends it's there.

and, to be fair, i hate the fact that this happens. i feel like i'm insane or something for feeling that, even
though it's like common amongst therians. physically feeling something that's not actually there feels really weird
and in a way just makes me feel incomplete, like yeah i can physically feel my tail but i can't hug it or anything.
other than the fact that it's embarrassing to explain as hell, like, how
would you explain this to anyone without sounding batshit insane?

i didn't even change after realizing i was a therian, i was already exactly like this way before realizing.
one day i thought about labels better and it just kinda clicked.

\*\*fun fact: lately i've been trying to lucid dream, and when i manage to, i just instantly turn myself into a cat
and i can just feel everything i have missing in real life until i wake up. it feels so real and so,
ugghhhhhh i need to be like that irl

## funny anecdote that i wanted to share

anyways, about three months after me realizing The Thing a group chat with some real life friends randomly mentioned therians.
it happened the same day geometry dash 2.2 came out. i was really shocked when i got the notification because i thought
that one friend was talking about it because she knew i was one, then i saw the full messages and calmed down.

![whatsapp convo between my friends](/images/convo.png#530)

that friend (if you're reading this, how the fuck did you get here) was trying to defend how therians are disgusting
basing her arguments on tiktok screenshots. i replied saying that tiktok doesn't reflect what they are at all
and that, while i don't understand about the topic (lol), i knew many from the geometry dash community and they were
nice individuals actually.

![the convo in a nutshell](/images/tiktok.png#460)

i told them that one i know from geometry dash had talked to me about it before, and that i couldn't remember
much but i would check the messages again to try to explain. (as you can imagine that friend never existed i made it up,
although later i did find friends like that from geometry dash).

the other friends from the group chat were pretty much indifferent, they didn't understand the topic at all.

the funniest part was when i was explaining that, for better or worse, most therians are advised by the community
to just hide about their identity forever, with a friend saying "thats kinda sad" while at the same time
i was hiding my identity from literally everyone from the group chat. the situation was just so
ironic it's really funny to think about.

## losing my mind

(looking back at old tweets, i probably hinted at it a bit too much)

![346](/images/clueless.png#346)

now you might ask, why am i talking about it now instead of just never telling anyone?

other than the fact that i'm literally neurodivergent & (considering the fact i turn 18 tomorrow) a minor,
its because it's really hard to just keep it to myself it's been in my head for a long time
and i just need to tell people how i feel. this is also why i often tweet things that seem to obviously
be about the topic but somehow no one has told me they related my tweet to it and/or suspected i was one.

funny enough it reminds me of the times before i officially came out as transgender to my real life friends.
i had a trans flag in my bio for more than a year and apparently my friends had already seen it and just couldn't tell if i
was serious or not and just never told me anything about it until i came out. chances are, at least one real life friend
probably understood my tweets and knows about it and just hasnt come up with it. that's both funny and terrifying as
if that's the case, i have no idea who it is and i can't know without asking them, immediately outing myself.

also, i now have a newest fear of someone searching my name online and this coming up as the second result.

it's hypothetically really funny thinking about the concept of someone having a breakdown over not being a cat until
somehow you are that someone and you do have breakdowns over it.

yeah, i'm pretty sure i'm a therian and it FUCKING SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!

WHY AM I LIKE THIS??????

WHAT THE FUCK AM I????????????????

like it's not even something that has medical research at all. but i experience it therefore at least it exists,
*whatever* that is, assuming its at least explainable in modern psychology terms.

I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE!!

i wish i could just, not have these issues and be fine with a human life, and not have whole afternoons
constantly wondering how it's even possible and feeling like shit about it, but after all, my identity isn't hurting
anything or anyone, and it's just how i feel most comfortable with myself. i just really fucking wish i was a cat.
i'm a cat. i need a hug. thanks for reading
