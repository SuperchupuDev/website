Released about 9 months ago, tinyglobby has contributed to the JavaScript ecosystem
as a globbing library with few dependencies. Since then, the library has gotten more than 9 million
weekly downloads and many big projects such as Vite have started using it.

We're really excited about the future of tinyglobby, and as such we want to announce
a new version to further advance what the JavaScript ecosystem is capable of. Introducing tinyglobby plus.

# tinyglobby plus

tinyglobby plus is everything tinyglobby was, and much more. It's an exercise in refinement, showcasing
the best-of-the-best JavaScript has to offer in 2025. tinyglobby plus redefines the way you interact
with a library. Ergonomic features allow for a smoother usage, while the redesigned API streamlines every task.

As such, we are proud to announce a total rewrite of tinyglobby featuring the latest state-of-the-art AI features.

## Redefined matching

Thanks to our new OpenAI integration, tinyglobby plus allows you to live your life easier.
not only does it allow you to use patterns like always, but it implements glob 2.0, which expands
the glob spec to also allow for natural language. As an added bonus, not only does this allow the library
to return matched files, it also can answer with natural language. Just ask it
lunch ideas!

```ts
import { glob } from 'tinyglobby-plus';

const result = await glob(`
                            Hey there, tinyglobby! I don't have anything to glob today, but i'd like
                            some help on my next lunch session. Do you have any ideas for a good lunch?
                          `, {
                            cwd: '/home/wotrarp/Documents/LUNCH_IDEAS',
                            openaiKey: 'sk-4B7zZ8HjKq3L0wRv6TmP1aNxQ9YlEfUdX5oC2sVrMhGk',
                            expandDirectories: false
                          });

console.log(result);
//          ^ ["quite certain! since you're a javascript developer, you could try eating the souls of your coworkers. hope this helps!"]
```

As always, it can match files like usual, but now with natural language:

```ts
import { glob } from 'tinyglobby-plus';

const result = await glob('Return files that end with ".java"', {
  cwd: '/home/wotrarp/Documents/work/INTERNAL_DO_NOT_LEAK',
  openaiKey: 'sk-M9v4Xr2tQ7pW1jZc3LmE6oBnA0yU5hFgKdTs8RqJeLb',
  expandDirectories: false
});

console.log(result);
//          ^ [
//              "BaseNuclearLaunchCode.java",
//              "NuclearLaunchCode.java",
//              "NuclearLaunchCodesBuilder.java"
//            ]
```

you're the product. That's why tinyglobby plus will cost $1000/month. Enjoy!
